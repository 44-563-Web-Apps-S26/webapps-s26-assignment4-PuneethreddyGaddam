     <h2>Iolanthe, or The Peer and the Peri</h2>

    <h3>Act I — Scene: An Arcadian Landscape</h3>

    <p><strong>SCENE.</strong>—An Arcadian Landscape. A river runs around the back of the
    stage. A rustic bridge crosses the river.</p>

    <p><em>Enter Fairies, led by Leila, Celia, and Fleta. They trip around
    the stage, singing as they dance.</em></p>

    <h4>CHORUS</h4>
    <p>
        Tripping hither, tripping thither,<br>
        Nobody knows why or whither;<br>
        We must dance and we must sing<br>
        Round about our fairy ring!
    </p>

    <h4>SOLO — CELIA</h4>
    <p>
        We are dainty little fairies,<br>
        Ever singing, ever dancing;<br>
        We indulge in our vagaries<br>
        In a fashion most entrancing.<br>
        If you ask the special function<br>
        Of our never-ceasing motion,<br>
        We reply, without compunction,<br>
        That we haven't any notion!
    </p>

    <h4>CHORUS</h4>
    <p>
        No, we haven't any notion!<br>
        Tripping hither, tripping thither!
    </p>

    <h4>SOLO — LEILA</h4>
    <p>
        If you ask us how we live,<br>
        Lovers all essentials give—<br>
        We can ride on lovers' sighs,<br>
        Warm ourselves in lovers' eyes,<br>
        Bathe ourselves in lovers' tears,<br>
        Clothe ourselves with lovers' fears,<br>
        Arm ourselves with lovers' darts,<br>
        Hide ourselves in lovers' hearts.<br>
        When you know us, you'll discover<br>
        That we almost live on lover!
    </p>

    <h4>CHORUS</h4>
    <p>
        Yes, we live on lover!<br>
        Tripping hither, tripping thither!
    </p>

    <p><em>(At the end of Chorus, all sigh wearily.)</em></p>

    <p><strong>CELIA.</strong> Ah, it's all very well, but since our Queen banished
    Iolanthe, fairy revels have not been what they were!</p>

    <p><strong>LEILA.</strong> Iolanthe was the life and soul of Fairyland. Why, she
    wrote all our songs and arranged all our dances!</p>

    <p><strong>FLETA.</strong> To think that five-and-twenty years have elapsed since
    she was banished!</p>

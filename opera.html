   <h2>Iolanthe</h2>

<h3>Act I — Scene: An Arcadian Landscape</h3>

<p><strong>SCENE.</strong> An Arcadian Landscape. A river runs around the back of the stage. A rustic bridge crosses the river.</p>

<p><em>[Enter Fairies, led by Leila (LEI), Celia (CEL), and Fleta (FLE). They trip around the stage, singing as they dance.]</em></p>


<h5>CHO</h5>
<p><em>CHORUS — Song</em></p>
<p>
Tripping hither, tripping thither,<br>
Nobody knows why or whither;<br>
We must dance and we must sing<br>
Round about our fairy ring!
</p>


<h5>CEL</h5>
<p><em>SOLO — Song</em></p>
<p>
We are dainty little fairies,<br>
Ever singing, ever dancing;<br>
We indulge in our vagaries<br>
In a fashion most entrancing.<br>
If you ask the special function<br>
Of our never-ceasing motion,<br>
We reply, without compunction,<br>
That we haven't any notion!
</p>


<h5>CHO</h5>
<p><em>CHORUS — Song</em></p>
<p>
No, we haven't any notion!<br>
Tripping hither, tripping thither!
</p>


<h5>LEI</h5>
<p><em>SOLO — Song</em></p>
<p>
If you ask us how we live,<br>
Lovers all essentials give—<br>
We can ride on lovers' sighs,<br>
Warm ourselves in lovers' eyes,<br>
Bathe ourselves in lovers' tears,<br>
Clothe ourselves with lovers' fears,<br>
Arm ourselves with lovers' darts,<br>
Hide ourselves in lovers' hearts.<br>
When you know us, you'll discover<br>
That we almost live on lover!
</p>


<h5>CHO</h5>
<p><em>CHORUS — Song</em></p>
<p>
Yes, we live on lover!<br>
Tripping hither, tripping thither!
</p>


<p><em>(At the end of Chorus, all sigh wearily.)</em></p>


<h5>CEL</h5>
<p><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong> Ah, it's all very well, but since our Queen banished Iolanthe, fairy revels have not been what they were!</p>


<h5>LEI</h5>
<p><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong> Iolanthe was the life and soul of Fairyland. Why, she wrote all our songs and arranged all our dances!</p>


<h5>FLE</h5>
<p><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong> To think that five-and-twenty years have elapsed since she was banished!</p>
